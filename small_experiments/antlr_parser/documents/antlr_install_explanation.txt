1. Install antlr4:
> sudo apt-get install antlr4

2. Install the antlr4 c++ library:
> sudo apt-get install libantlr4-runtime

3. Make sure the folder that contains the header files
for antlr is included in your include-paths.
This usually is the following path:
> /usr/include/antlr4-runtime

4. Make sure flags for the library are given to the
linker. This is is the following flag:
> -lantlr4-runtime

5. The flag from 4 points to a file libantlr-runtime.so.
Check whether this file is in a folder where it can be
found.
